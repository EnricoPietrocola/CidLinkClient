## How to use
* Connect to a server
* Join a room (one will be automatically created if no room has the requested name)
* Send anything to the 'datachannel' channel and it will be broadcasted to all users connected in a room.

To see how the objects work, create a [CidLinkClient] or a [CidLinkServer] object in your patch and open the helpfiles.
